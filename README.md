## Problem Statement 

New York City is one of the most visited and most expensive cities in the world. I have created a weekend guide that allows users to visit NYC on a budget. We will explore a model that uses image recognition to classify 10 popular landmarks measured by accuracy and an app that provides users with the history and some recommendations to do in the area.
